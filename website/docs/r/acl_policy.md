# rundeck\_acl_policy

The acl policy resource allows Rundeck projects to be managed by Terraform.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "local_file" "acl" {
  filename = "${path.module}/acl.yaml"
}

resource "rundeck_acl_policy" "example" {
  name = "ExampleAcl.aclpolicy"

  policy = "${data.local_file.acl.content}"
}
```

Note that the above configuration assumes the existence of an ``acl.yaml`` file in the
project directory. This resource passes the raw YAML policy string to Rundeck which stores
and returns it as-is. A future ``acl_policy_document`` data source is planned to allow defining
the policy in terraform configuration.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the policy. Must end with `.aclpolicy`.

* `policy` - (Required) The name of the job, used to describe the job in the Rundeck UI.

> Note: This example uses an ACL Policy file stored at the current working directory named `acl.yaml`.  Valid contents for that file are shown below.
